# BigInt-in-c-
This repository contains a robust implementation of BigInt, an arbitrary-precision integer library in C++. Unlike standard integer types, BigInt can handle extremely large numbers with ease, making it ideal for cryptography, scientific computations, and any application requiring precision beyond the limits of built-in data types.

FEATURES:

-Support for large integers: Store and manipulate integers far larger than native types allow.

-Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

-Comparison operators: Equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, etc.

-Bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts.

-Modular arithmetic: Support for modulo operations.

-Input/Output support: Easily read from and write to streams in decimal, hexadecimal, and other bases.



GETTING STARTED:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BigInt.git
Include the header file in your project: #include "BigInt.h"
Start using BigInt in your C++ applications!


EXAMPLES:

BigInt a = "12345678901234567890";

BigInt b = "98765432109876543210";

BigInt c = a + b;

std::cout << "Sum: " << c << std::endl;
